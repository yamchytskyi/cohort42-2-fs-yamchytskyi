DRY - don't repeat yourself

SSOT - single source of truth - only repository should change database data

KISS - make it stupid simple

SOLID

S - ! single responsibility principle
one methode should to do one thing.
(if your method calls doItAndIt - it's a shit, because "and". so only one thing)

O - open/close
your modules should be available to extends but closed to changing

L - Liskov substitution principle
classes, which extend basic classes,
 should be available to use children of that class without knowing
 their realisation

I - interface segregation principle
interfaces should contain same area logic
it's better to do two small interfaces that one big

D - dependency inversion principle
it's better to use abstraction
